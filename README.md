# Weekend Health - Coding Assessment

Coding assessment for the Full Stack Software Engineer position at Weekend Health

### Assignment Instructions:

Please write a function that accepts a single string as input,
and that returns a list of English words that can be created
using some combination of the letters in the input string.

Example input: "oogd"
Example output: ["good", "god", "dog", "goo", "do", "go"]

You can assume you'll be given an array of strings that enumerates
all valid English words. To determine whether a word is a valid
word, you can simply check for its presence in the array
(e.g., `WORDS.includes(word)`)

### Running the app:

Please note `node` and `npx` are required. From the root directory in a terminal window:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
